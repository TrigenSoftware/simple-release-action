# üöÄ simple-release-action

A simple GitHub Action to automate version bumps, changelogs, and releases using [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org).

- üìÑ Uses [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to parse commits, determine the next version, and generate a changelog.
- üóÇÔ∏è Supports monorepos and can release multiple packages in a single run.
- üß© Flexible and extensible with custom addons for different project types.

See [simple-release docs](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/simple-release/tree/main/packages/core#readme) for more details.

## Usage

1. Create `.simple-release.json` config file with project setup in repository root:

```json
{
  "project": ["@simple-release/pnpm#PnpmWorkspacesProject", {
    "mode": "fixed"
  }]
}
```

<details>
<summary>js-config example</summary>

You should install the addon package first, then:

```js
import { PnpmWorkspacesProject } from '@simple-release/pnpm'

export const project = new PnpmWorkspacesProject({
  mode: 'fixed'
})
```

</details>

In this example [@simple-release/pnpm](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/simple-release/blob/main/packages/pnpm#readme) is used to setup a monorepo project with fixed versioning mode.

You can find other addons in the [simple-release repository](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/simple-release).

2. Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` with release workflow, like in the example below:

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, deleted]
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Check if release job should run
    outputs:
      continue: ${{ steps.check.outputs.continue }}
      workflow: ${{ steps.check.outputs.workflow }}
    steps:
      - name: Check context
        id: check
        uses: trigensoftware/simple-release-action@v1
        with:
          workflow: check
  pull-request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Pull request
    needs: check
    if: needs.check.outputs.workflow == 'pull-request'
    steps:
      - name: Create or update pull request
        uses: trigensoftware/simple-release-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Release
    needs: check
    if: needs.check.outputs.workflow == 'release'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 10
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'pnpm'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
      - name: Release notes and publish
        uses: trigensoftware/simple-release-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

Now every time you push to the `main` branch, the action will create or update a pull request with release changes if necessary. When the pull request is merged, it will automatically release the project. Also you can comment on the pull request to pass additional options to simple-release:

````md
!simple-release/set-options

```json
{
  "bump": {
    "prerelease": "alpha"
  }
}
```
````

## Options

### workflow

Workflow to run.

- `full`: create PR with release changes and release on merge (default)
- `pull-request`: create PR with release changes
- `release`: run release on release commit
- `check`: run context check to skip unnecessary runs (e.g. on issue_comment) and determines workflow to run

### github-token

GitHub token to authenticate with the GitHub API.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to run workflows on PR created by this action, you need to use a personal access token instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### npm-token

NPM token to authenticate with the NPM registry. Passed to `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` env variable.

### publish-token

Generic token to use in config file. Passed to `PUBLISH_TOKEN` env variable.

### branch

Branch to store release changes and create pull request from. Defaults to `simple-release`.
